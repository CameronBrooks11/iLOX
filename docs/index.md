## Paper Thoughts

{: .note }
These are just some unorganized thoughts, gladly disregard!

- Interlocking metasurfaces (ILMs) are engineered arrays of complementary features that facilitate the joining of two bodies.
  - Unlike traditional methods such as bolts, adhesives, or welds, ILMs offer easy assembly, disassembly, and reassembly while maintaining robust mechanical properties.
  - They function across a surface in a quasi-continuous manner, enabling the connection of complex structures like lattices.
- Categorization of ILMs
  - Complementary Surface Features:
    - These involve matching protrusions and indentations on mating surfaces that fit together precisely.
    - Example: LEGO™ bricks utilize this principle, where studs on one brick align with recesses on another.
  - Elastic Interlocking Elements:
    - Features that elastically deform during assembly to lock into place, often resembling arrow-like structures that bend to engage.
    - Example: Designs where protruding elements with tips engage upon assembly, maintaining the interlock through the engagement of these tips.
- Workflow for Applying ILMs to a Design Problem:
  - Define Requirements: Determine the mechanical load, environmental conditions, and assembly/disassembly needs of the joint.
  - Select Appropriate ILM Design: Choose an ILM category that aligns with the project’s requirements, considering factors like load-bearing capacity and ease of assembly.
  - Customize Feature Geometry: Tailor the dimensions and shapes of interlocking features to ensure a precise fit and desired mechanical performance.
  - Prototype and Test: Create prototypes of the ILM design and conduct mechanical testing to assess strength, durability, and functionality.
  - Iterate Design: Refine the ILM features based on testing feedback to optimize performance and address any issues.
  - Finalize and Implement: Once validated, integrate the ILM into the final product design, ensuring compatibility with manufacturing processes.
